## Who I Am

I'm Nicholas, a security researcher focused on the often-overlooked world of industrial control systems, IoT devices, and critical infrastructure security. My work sits at the intersection of offensive security research and defensive strategy—understanding how attackers think so we can build better defenses.

## What I Do

My research spans several areas:

**Industrial Control Systems (ICS/OT Security)**
I explore vulnerabilities in industrial systems and critical infrastructure, analyzing attack patterns and defensive strategies for systems that keep our world running.

**Honeypot Research & Deployment**
I design and deploy honeypots (particularly Conpot) to study attacker behavior, gather threat intelligence, and understand real-world attack patterns targeting industrial systems.

**IoT Security & Exploit Development**
From analyzing IoT vulnerabilities to developing proof-of-concept exploits, I dive deep into the security challenges of our increasingly connected world.

**Tool Development**
I build security tools and share them with the community—because good security research should be reproducible and accessible.

## Why This Blog

This blog serves as my digital lab notebook. I document my research, share tools I've built, write tutorials on complex topics, and explore security concepts that interest me. If you're into ICS security, honeypot deployment, or just curious about offensive security research, you're in the right place.

My goal is to make complex security topics more accessible while contributing to the broader security research community. Every post represents something I've learned, built, or discovered—and hopefully, it helps you learn something too.
